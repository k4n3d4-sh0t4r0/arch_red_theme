# Arch red theme

Dark and Red theme for linux arch. It uses pre-installed applications with xfce, which avoids a complicated installation process and doesn't use a lot of memory.

This github is mostly there in case I need to do a fresh install. But take what you want from my theme and modify it if you wish.

Keep it simple, stupid

`Xfce`

# Additional info

In the screenshots, don't pay attention to the shell line in neofetch, I don't know why but neofetch says I'm using bash as a shell when I'm using zsh with OhMyZsh. I haven't looked into the reason for this bug yet.
